# Analysis of Deaths-of-Shelter-Residents-in-Toronto-From-2007-2024

This dataset, spanning from 2007 to 2024, tracks monthly mortality rates across three gender categories: Male, Female, and Transgender/Non-binary/Two-Spirit. The data contains a total of 212 monthly entries, with information on the total number of decedents each month and their respective gender breakdowns. Notably, a significant proportion of entries for the Transgender/Non-binary/Two-Spirit category are missing, with about 73.58% of the data absent in this column. To address this, missing values were imputed with zeros, which might suggest no decedents in those months for that category.

The descriptive statistics indicate that, on average, there were about 3.83 total deaths per month, with male decedents averaging higher (mean = 2.99) compared to females (mean = 0.79). Transgender/Non-binary/Two-Spirit deaths were the least reported, with an average of 0.21 deaths per month. The highest number of deaths recorded in a single month was 19, with a maximum of 16 male decedents and 5 female decedents in individual months. This dataset provides a valuable foundation for analyzing mortality trends over time and across gender, although the missing data may affect insights regarding gender diversity in death rates.
